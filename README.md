Object Detection Project : 
This project demonstrates a basic Object Detection system using Python. The system uses a pre-trained model to detect objects in images or videos and draws bounding boxes around them.

Features : 
Detects multiple objects in real-time using a webcam .
Works with static images for object detection.
Displays class labels and confidence scores for detected objects.

Requirements :
Make sure to install the following dependencies before running the project:
Python 3.x
OpenCV
NumPy

You can install these dependencies using the following command: 
pip install opencv-python numpy

Acknowledgments :
Special thanks to the OpenCV community for their excellent support and documentation.
